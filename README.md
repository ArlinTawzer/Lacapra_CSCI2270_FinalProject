# Lacapra_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project Repository

Project Summary:
This project is a tool to teach students about Binary Trees. There are 7 options in the main menu that allow the user to explore the various functionalities of a Binary Tree. The first 4 options allow the user to perform operations on the tree, get information about the tree, reformat the tree, and print the tree according to different types of traversals. The remaining three options allow the user to reset the tree to the default settings, delete all information from the tree, and quit the program.

How to Run:
Open the program with Xcode and set the command line argument with the included tree.txt file, or any other text file containing integer values formatted in the same way as the example file. The final step is to compile the program.
