# Lacapra_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project Repository

Project Summary:
This project is a tool to teach students about the functions of a Binary Tree. The program takes a command line argument and loads a basic tree from a text file. The user then has 7 menu options to choose from. The first option allows the user to insert, lookup, and delete from the tree. The second option allows the user to find information about the tree including the size, the max value, the min value, the max depth, and if the tree is a valid binary tree. The third option allows the user to perform different operations with the existing tree such as mirroring the tree, doubling the tree, and finding a root to leaf path with a sum inputted by the user. The fourth option allows the user to print the values in the tree post order, pre order, in order, or printed in a way to visually see the tree. The fifth option allows the user to reset the tree to the default settings. The sixth allows the user to delete all the values from the tree, and the final option is to quit the program.

How to Run:
Download the zip file which contains BinaryTree.cpp, BinaryTree.h, PrettyPrint.cpp, PrettyPrint.h, the driver file, and a text file to pass into the program as a command line argument. To run the program, set the scheme to include the text file, and compile.
