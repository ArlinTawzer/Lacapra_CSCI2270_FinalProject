Once the program’s command line arguments are set and the program is compiled, the first thing you should see is the main menu pictured below. Each option corresponds to a different function menu for the tree, aside from the last three options.

======Main Menu=====
1. Tree Functions
2. Tree Information
3. Tree Operations
4. Print Tree
5. Reset Tree
6. Delete Tree
7. Quit

When the user selects the first option, another menu should pop up. This allows the user to insert a value into the tree, lookup a value in the tree, and delete a value from the tree

=====Tree Functions=====
1. Insert a value — this prompts the user for a value and then inserts it into the tree
2. Lookup a value - this prompts the user for a value, searches the tree, and displays messages if found or not
3. Delete a value - this prompts the user for a value, searches the tree, and deletes it if found
4. Main Menu — returns to the main menu

=====Tree Information=====
1. Tree Size — displays the number of nodes in the tree
2. Max Depth — displays the height of the tree
3. Min Value - displays the minimum value in the tree
4. Max Value - displays the maximum value in the tree
5. Valid Tree - checks to see if the tree is a valid binary search tree, and displays a message if it is or not
6. Main Menu - returns to the main menu

=====Tree Operations=====
1. Double Tree
2. Mirror Tree
3. Find Path Sum
4. Main Menu

In this menu, the user performs functions that alter the structure of the tree. For example, the tree contains values 40, 30, and 20:

  30
 /  \
20  40

Once the user selects the first option, the tree is doubled and the output is the new tree:

=====Tree Operations=====
1. Double Tree
2. Mirror Tree
3. Find Path Sum
4. Main Menu

Doubled Tree: 

        ______30______
       /              \
    __30            __40  
   /               /       
  20              40        
 /                           
20               

If the user selects the option to mirror the tree, the tree new tree is displayed:

=====Tree Operations=====
1. Double Tree
2. Mirror Tree
3. Find Path Sum
4. Main Menu

Mirrored Tree: 

        ______30______
       /              \
      40__            30__
          \               \
          40              20
                            \
                            20

If the user selects find path sum, the user is prompted for a value and the output displays a message if the sum exists or if there is no root-to-leaf path that sums to the user’s value.

=====Tree Operations=====
1. Double Tree
2. Mirror Tree
3. Find Path Sum
4. Main Menu

Enter value:
100
The answer is yes.

The final option returns to the main menu.

======Main Menu=====
1. Tree Functions
2. Tree Information
3. Tree Operations
4. Print Tree
5. Reset Tree
6. Delete Tree
7. Quit
4

=====Print the Tree=====
1. Postorder Traversal — prints the values in a list according to post-order traversal
2. Preorder Traversal - prints the values in a list according to pre-order traversal
3. In Order Traversal - prints the values in order in a list
4. Pretty Print
5. Main Menu
4

The pretty print option formats the existing tree with the appropriate spacing like this:

        ______30______
       /              \
    __20__          __40__
   /      \        /      \
  11      25      35      45
 /  \    /  \    /  \    /  \
10  15  22  27  32  37  42  50


The final option again returns to the main menu. 

Upon returning to the main menu, the remaining three options are to reset the tree, delete the tree and quit.

======Main Menu=====
1. Tree Functions
2. Tree Information
3. Tree Operations
4. Print Tree
5. Reset Tree — this deletes the existing tree, reloads the tree from the file, and displays the main menu.
6. Delete Tree - this deletes all nodes in the tree and displays the main menu once finished.
7. Quit

The final option quits the program and displays the message “Goodbye!”
